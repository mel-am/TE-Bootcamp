    <h2 id="heading">The Travelling Photographer - The Best Travel Photography of 2023</h2>
    
    <section class="article-1"><img src="./img/Pienza.avif" alt="Overview of Pienza"><p>There's nothing quite like the power of a photograph to truly capture the heart of a place—and awaken the travel bug inside us all. But with social media inundated with images of far-flung destinations, the search for high-quality travel photography can often be a tougher pursuit. So, in place of scrolling, why not let an expert panel of judges filter out the best of the best for you?

        This week, the international Travel Photographer of the Year (TPOTY) awards announced their 2023 winners, selected from more than 20,000 images taken by amateur and professional photographers from over 150 countries. The judging of the competition takes place over three rounds; all 16 judges are leading photographers or experts in the field and are not made aware of the identity or nationality of any entrants.
        
        Ranging from ethereal landscapes of the Italian countryside to striking portraits in Pakistan and Russia, the winning shots—including the celebrated work of Travel Photographer of the Year AndreJa Ravnak—reflect a “subtle elegance," says TPOTY founder Chris Coe.</p></section>

    <h2>Rolling Fields</h2>
    <section class ="article-2"><img src="./img/Green-fields.avif" alt="overview of a person walking through a green field"><p>Overall Winner—The Travel Photographer of the Year 2023 (AndreJa Ravnak, Slovenia): “Early in the spring, the first rains allow wheat to grow in the rolling fields. Due to the cold nights, the landscape is often shrouded in beautiful mists on clear mornings during this period. This agricultural landscape is sparsely populated, with land being used to its fullest potential. Farms are located on the top of individual hills.”</p></section>

    <section class ="article-3"><img src="./img/orchard.avif" alt="an orchard in early spring"><p>Overall Winner—The Travel Photographer of the Year 2023 (AndreJa Ravnak, Slovenia): “In early spring, the soil is still too cold for growth. An interesting pattern occured while a new orchard was planted on the slope of the hill, making the scene very abstract.”</p></section>

    <h3>Near Pienza, Tuscany, Italy</h3>
    <section class ="article-4"><img src="./img/man-on-tractor.avif" alt="man on a tractor in a field"><p>Overall Winner—The Travel Photographer of the Year 2023 (AndreJa Ravnak, Slovenia): “A tractor driver maneuveres a high trailer with a crew of workers on top, manually tying strings to steel cables for hop growing. In the spring, the fields must be prepared for a new season and new strings must be strung. The process is done by hand, but there is not enough interest in this type of work in Slovenia, so hop growers hire workers from abroad every year. Seasonal workers from Romania are regular visitors to the Savinja Valley.”</p></section>
